# Lubomir Skoupil - Energy Markets Risk Manager, Analyst
Simple one-page personal website created from the scratch (many thanks to contributors on W3Schools, stackoverflow!)

JavaScript code copied word-for-word from https://www.includehelp.com/code-snippets/javascript-select-unselect-check-unckecck-all-checkboxes.aspx

Used: Atom, Spyder (background created in Python matplotlib), FormSpree for Contact form

The background is a map of Europe I sometimes use for presentation of location data or for drawing transmission paths

TODO: fix font-size issues (especially inside the buttons), add Portfolio section
