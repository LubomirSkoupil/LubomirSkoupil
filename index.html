              <label for="ToolsPnL" class="PnL">Profit and Loss (PnL)</label>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  Stable and precise PnL is at the heart of front office and
                  middle office processes and controls. During my time at Ezpada
                  I had the opportunity to work on several concepts of various
                  types of PnL including energy products (standard profiles,
                  shapes, transmission rights, multicurrency portfolios), FX and
                  standardized exchange-traded commodity contracs.
                </p>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  In 2015 I designed significant part of the PnL system Ezpada
                  uses to this day - the system was built on reliable forward
                  curves (one curve per grid, hourly granularity for power and
                  gas), PnL calculated on position rather than individual tickets
                  and on Total-to-Day PnL differences.
                </p>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  In paralell to the official PnL implemented by IT I created
                  several SQL and Python tools helping us explain and troubleshoot
                  the official PnL (<i>for example tool showing traders positions
                  carried from one day to another and detail of PnL the positions
                  generated between these days</i>).

                <p class='Detail'>
                  Reliable forward curves (FWC) with hourly granularity are a
                  must-have for a well performing PnL and other Risk processes
                  (credit, volatility and correlation estimation and modelling,
                  cash flow projections).
                </p>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  I cooperated with IT on implementation of FWC for power and
                  gas grids and I introduced several stabilizing concepts into
                  the algorithm:
                </p>
                <ul class='Detail'>
                  <li>
                    price source prioritization (<i>for example "CZ: Trayport >
                    PXE > brokers"; this way if Trayport marking fails and PXE
                    does not publish prices, broker marks would be used for
                    calculation and only small adjustment, if any, will be
                    needed</i>)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    discarding the least liquid product prices in case of conflict
                    (in March there will sometimes be quotes for Q2, Apr, May and
                    June contracts, where the weighted average of monthly quotes
                    does not equal quote for Q2, which creates confusion; this
                    gest solved by disregarding the least liquid product quote -
                    in this instance June)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    including seasonality: this increases precision of the curves
                    as it decreases valuation jumps for products that are becomming
                    more liquid
