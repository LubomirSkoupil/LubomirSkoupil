                <p class='Detail'>
                  Stable and precise PnL is at the heart of front office and
                  middle office processes and controls. During my time at Ezpada
                  I had the opportunity to work on several concepts of various
                  types of PnL including energy products (standard profiles,
                  shapes, transmission rights, multicurrency portfolios), FX and
                  standardized exchange-traded commodity contracts.
                </p>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  In 2015 I designed significant part of the PnL system Ezpada
                  uses to this day - the system was built on reliable forward
                  curves (one curve per grid, hourly granularity for power and
                  gas), PnL calculated on position rather than individual tickets
                  and on Total-to-Day PnL differences.
                </p>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  In parallel to the official PnL implemented by IT I created
                  several SQL and Python tools helping us explain and troubleshoot
                  the official PnL (<i>for example tool showing traders positions
                  carried from one day to another and detail of PnL the positions
                  generated between these days</i>).

              <label for="ToolsVaR" class="VaR">Value at Risk (VaR)</label>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  Despite its many problems VaR enables Risk Managers and
                  Management to see the riskiness of the portfolio condensed
                  into a single figure, that can be easily interpreted even by
                  non-technical users.
                </p>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  In Ezpada I created one simple VaR model (historical, linear
                  positions only, excluding current month positions) and later I
                  cooperated on creating (supplying most of the SQL functions for
                  positions and prices) and design of much more complex VaR model
                  (Monte Carlo, volatility weighted, all positions from Day Ahead,
                  including option portfolio).
                </p>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  I also have a lot of experience of reconciliating the VaR model
                  results with Trading's expectations and helping Trading keep
                  their exposure within the defined set of limits.

                <p class='Detail'>
                  Reliable forward curves (FWC) with hourly granularity are a
                  must-have for a well performing PnL and other Risk processes
                  (credit, volatility and correlation estimation and modelling,
                  cash flow projections).
                </p>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  I cooperated with IT on implementation of FWC for power and
                  gas grids and introduced several stabilizing concepts into
                  the algorithm:
                </p>
                <ul class='Detail'>
                  <li>
                    price source prioritization (<i>example: "CZ: Trayport >
                    PXE > brokers"; this way if Trayport marking fails and PXE
                    does not publish prices, broker marks would be used for
                    calculation and only small adjustment, if any, will be
                    needed</i>)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    discarding the least liquid product prices in case of conflict
                    (in March there will sometimes be quotes for Q2, Apr, May and
                    June contracts, where the weighted average of monthly quotes
                    does not equal quote for Q2, which creates confusion; this
                    gest solved by disregarding the least liquid product quote -
                    in this instance June)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    including seasonality: this increases precision of the curves
                    as it decreases valuation jumps for products that are becoming
                    more liquid
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <label for="ToolsCF" class="CF">Cash Flow projections</label>
              <p class='Detail'>
                Cash Flow projection is an important tool, especially for small
                companies trading with commodities with physical delivery - seeing
                potential problems well ahead of time gives Treasury and Risk
                departments enough flexibility to deal with the issues without
                unnecessary stress and cost.
              </p>
              <p class='Detail'>
                I created a Cash Flow report including projections of payments for
                commodities with physical and financial delivery (OTC and exchanges)
                and payments of taxes and fees that are settled periodically.

                <p class='Detail'>
                There are many problems with marking on energy markets:
                </p>
                <ul class='Detail'>
                  <li>
                    illiquid products
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    energy is heavily traded in spreads - especially location and
                    time spreads are widely popular
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    external sources often mark at different times causing high
                    volatility of PnL and exaggerated VaR in portfolios including
                    products marked based on different sources
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class='Detail'>
                  To avoid these problems, I developed and implemented an
                  algorithm marking automatically based on real-time Trayport
                  data (bids, offers, concluded trades on outright products).
                  The algorithm allowed for marking on spread - the "trailing"
                  market would follow the "base" market unless the trailing
                  mark would get outside of the best bid / offer range of the
                  trailing product, in which case the marked spread would either
                  widen or narrow.
